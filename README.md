Volumetric Water Content at 10kPa, 33kPa, and 1500kPa suction in 10^-3 cm^3/cm^3 (0.1 v% or 1 mm/m) at 6 standard depths (0-5cm, 5-15cm, 15-30cm, 30-60cm, 60-100cm, 100-200cm). Predictions were derived using a digital soil mapping approach based on Quantile Random Forest, drawing on a global compilation of soil profile data and environmental layers. This dataset includes predictions for three different suction levels, providing insights into soil water availability.
